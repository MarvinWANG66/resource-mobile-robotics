## Course description
Theory and application of probabilistic and geometric techniques for autonomous mobile robotics. This course presents and critically examines contemporary algorithms for robot perception. Topics include Bayesian filtering; stochastic representations of the environment; motion and sensor models for mobile robots; algorithms for mapping, localization; application to autonomous marine, ground, and air vehicles.

## Class Goals
Learn the math and algorithms underneath state-of-the-art robotic systems. The majority of these techniques are heavily based on geometric and probabilistic reasoning---an area with extensive applicability in modern robotics. An intended side-effect of the course is to strengthen your expertise in this area.

- Implement, and experiment with these algorithms.
- Be able to understand research papers in the field of robotics.
- Try out some ideas/extensions of your own.

Note: the focus of the course is on math and algorithms. We will not study the mechanical or electrical design of robots.
